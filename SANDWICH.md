The perfect sandwich is made with quality ingredients, thoughtful layering, and attention to texture and flavor. Here are a few things to consider when making a sandwich. 

## *Layer intentionally.*

* Spread condiments on the bottom slice of bread, then add densest ingredients like pickles, followed by lettuce and tomato, cheese, and meat.

* Finish with another layer of condiments on top.

> When in doubt, add some mayo!

## *Consider texture.*

* Choose breads that add texture and crunch. You can also add other elements for texture, like potato chips, fresh herbs, or hard and soft cheeses.

## *Get the ratio right.*

* Some say the perfect sandwich has a 1:1 ratio of bread to filling.
